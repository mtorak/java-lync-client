A java client for Microsoft Lync 2013 Server Unified Communications Web API(UCWA) which is a REST API that exposes Lync Server 2013 Instant Messaging and Presence capabilities.

<li>This code is all free, copy/edit/redistribute as you wish ;)</li>
<li>This is just a raw implementation, an experimental work. There may be mistakes/better ways of some implementation etc. Just use this as a working sample code and improve according to your needs. Actually i have no time to improve this..</li>
</ol>

<p>
The base class for this UCWA REST client is LyncClient. Lync server authentication is done with a single user account and the token sent from lync server is used for all subsequent requests. LyncClient holds an authenticationMap to store the token. `LyncGatewayServlet` holds an instance of `LyncClient` and passes presence/contact note/instant message requests to this client.

<p>
<b>Here is the basic execution logic: </b>
<ol>
<li>`LyncClient.authenticationMap` is peeked when a request came, if there is a token there then it is used as Authorization header for the http request which is sent to Lync Server 2013. If not then `LyncClient.authenticate()` method is called which makes authentication requests and puts the provided token to the authenticationMap. This token has an 8 hour of validity.(it may be a configurable value on the server)</li>
<li>If the authentication token is timed out, then Lync 2013 server responds with an HTTP Error 401 Unauthorized response. In this case `authenticate()` is called and old token is replaced with the new one. Authentication requests are sent by only one thread, because all the lync operations are done with a single token. So this parts of code are thread safe. (To enable multi-user support: for each sip there should be a different token in the `authenticationMap`, edit this parts if you need a multi-user java client for lync 2013 ucwa api. But in our case we only needed to get presence and contact note of users via a single lync account.)</li>
<li>UCWA REST API requests are sent via Apache HttpClient API version 4.2.1. `PoolingClientConnectionManager` of this api is used to manage http connections. </li>
<li>`LyncGatewayServlet` is used as a proxy to send lync presence/contact note/instant message etc. requests. All the responses are in JSON format.</li></ol></p>
